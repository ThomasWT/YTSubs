# YTSubs: AI-Powered YouTube Subtitle generator

### Disclaimer
This is just a small sideproject. It does not include any best practice and is more a proof of concept than something really useful. If you can make it or fork it into something useful, feel free to do so

YTSubs is a web application that allows users to generate subtitles from YouTube videos using Client side loaded models from [transformers.js](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js/tree/v3)

> [!WARNING]  
> As of October 2024, global WebGPU support is around 70% (according to [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/webgpu)), meaning some users may not be able to use the API.
